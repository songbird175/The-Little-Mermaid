# The-Little-Mermaid

As part of a research team investigating gender roles in children's literature, I decided to examine the effects of genderbending the characters in Disney's The Little Mermaid. I wrote a rudimentary script to automatically adjust the story by changing gendered words, and the 2,000+ stories in the Ariel_she, Ariel_he, and Ariel_they folders are the result.

Moving forward, I will likely work on the script to make it re-usable. The goal will be to write a script that can be used on any children's book, and to change pronouns based on what the user wants.

I will also work on rewriting The Little Mermaid in more involved ways, as well as quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing the genderbent stories.
