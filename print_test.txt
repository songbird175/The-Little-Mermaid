0 Far beneath the ocean waves, in the land of the merpeople, lived a lovely young   END
1 mermaid  END
2  named Ariel.   END
3 Her  END
4  home was an undersea palace. Although it was quite magnificent,   END
5 she  END
6  hardly ever spent time there.   END
7 She  END
8  preferred to go exploring with   END
9 her  END
10  little friend Flounder, the fish.
Ariel loved to collect objects from the world above the sea.   END
11 She  END
12  and Flounder would swim in and out of sunken ships, picking up whatever caught the Little   END
13 Mermaid  END
14 's fancy.

Ariel's   END
15 father  END
16 ,   END
17 King  END
18  Triton, ruled the undersea kingdom.   END
19 He  END
20  was very proud of Ariel's many gifts, especially   END
21 her  END
22  beautiful singing voice.   END
23 He  END
24  had arranged to give a special concert to show   END
25 his  END
26    END
27 daughter  END
28 's wonderful talent to all the merfolk.
Ariel's sisters sang to begin the concert. Then they sang a special song to introduce Ariel.
But Ariel wasn't there!
Triton was not pleased. How could Ariel have forgotten to show up for   END
29 her  END
30  own debut?

As usual, Ariel was off exploring.   END
31 She  END
32  had found a sunken ship to play in and had forgotten all about the concert. By the time   END
33 she  END
34  returned home, the guests had left. Triton was so angry that   END
35 he  END
36  ordered   END
37 Sebastian  END
38 , a crab who was   END
39 his  END
40  court composer, to follow Ariel and keep   END
41 her  END
42  out of trouble.

Later that day, Ariel slipped away again, with   END
43 Sebastian  END
44  following close behind.   END
45 She  END
46  hadn't gone far when a huge shadow darkened the waters above.
"It's a ship!"   END
47 she  END
48  gasped with delight.

Ariel swam to the surface to get a closer look. There were humans on board! One of them was very handsome. Ariel heard the others call   END
49 him  END
50    END
51 Prince  END
52    END
53 Eric  END
54 .

But as Ariel watched, a sudden storm took them all by surprise. To   END
55 her  END
56  horror, the ship began to sink. Most of the people on board were able to climb safely into a lifeboat. But the handsome young   END
57 prince  END
58  was hit by a falling spar and thrown into the churning water.

Ariel knew that humans could not live under the sea.   END
59 She  END
60  had to save the unconscious   END
61 prince  END
62 . There was no time to lose!

Ariel darted through the waves to the   END
63 prince  END
64  as   END
65 her  END
66  friend, Scuttle, watched anxiously.

Using all   END
67 her  END
68  strength, Ariel dragged the young   END
69 prince  END
70  to shore. Scuttle was waiting for them. The silly bird put   END
71 his  END
72  ear close to   END
73 Eric  END
74 's boot!
"Sorry, Ariel, I can't make out a heartbeat," said Scuttle.

Ariel placed   END
75 her  END
76  head on the   END
77 prince  END
78 's chest.
"Oh,   END
79 he  END
80  is breathing, Scuttle!"   END
81 she  END
82  cried.
  END
83 She  END
84  was so happy that   END
85 she  END
86  began to sing to the   END
87 prince  END
88 . At the sound of Ariel's lovely voice,   END
89 Eric  END
90 's eyelids began to flutter.

"  END
91 He  END
92 's going to be all right," Ariel said gratefully. "Now I'd better get back before   END
93 Father  END
94  finds out I've left."
When the   END
95 prince  END
96  opened   END
97 his  END
98  eyes, all   END
99 he  END
100  saw was   END
101 his  END
102  faithful dog, Max, running up to   END
103 him  END
104 .

Ariel returned home, but   END
105 she  END
106  couldn't forget the human   END
107 prince  END
108 . As   END
109 she  END
110  sat thinking about   END
111 him  END
112 , two evil eels named Flotsam and Jetsam watched   END
113 her  END
114  with their cunning eyes.

"Come with us," they coaxed sweetly. "We know someone who can help you."
Ariel followed the slippery eels. Before   END
115 she  END
116 knew it, they were inside the deep, dark cave of   END
117 Ursula  END
118 , the Sea   END
119 Witch  END
120 !

  END
121 Ursula  END
122  knew how much Ariel missed   END
123 Eric  END
124 .   END
125 She  END
126  told the young   END
127 mermaid  END
128  that   END
129 she  END
130  could help   END
131 her  END
132  visit   END
133 him  END
134  - for a price!

"I will make you human so you can visit your young   END
135 man  END
136 ,"   END
137 Ursula  END
138  said. "But you must get   END
139 him  END
140  to fall in love and kiss you before the sun sets on the third day. If you fail, you will turn back into a   END
141 mermaid  END
142  and return to the sea as my slave!"
Then   END
143 Ursula  END
144  laughed wickedly. "Oh, and one other thing. You must leave your voice with me!"

Poor Ariel!   END
145 She  END
146  would have done anything to see the young   END
147 prince  END
148  again. So   END
149 she  END
150  signed the agreement! Then the evil   END
151 witch  END
152  locked Ariel's beautiful voice inside a magic seashell that   END
153 she  END
154  wore around   END
155 her  END
156  neck.

Flounder and   END
157 Sebastian  END
158  watched in amazement as   END
159 Ursula  END
160 's magic powers changed Ariel into a human   END
161 girl  END
162 . Suddenly Ariel could no longer live underwater. Luckily,   END
163 her  END
164  two friends rushed   END
165 her  END
166  up to the surface so   END
167 her  END
168  could breathe.
  END
169 Ursula  END
170  cackled with glee.   END
171 She  END
172  intended to make sure Ariel did not get   END
173 her  END
174  kiss!

Once Ariel was safe on the beach, Scuttle said, "There's something different about you, Ariel. I just can't put my foot on it."
Ariel showed   END
175 him  END
176    END
177 her  END
178  two legs.   END
179 She  END
180  wanted to tell Scuttle about what had happened. But since   END
181 Ursula  END
182  had taken   END
183 her  END
184  voice,   END
185 Sebastian  END
186  had to explain.

When Ariel tried to stand,   END
187 she  END
188  found that balancing on   END
189 her  END
190  new legs was harder than it looked. "You can do it," said Scuttle. "Just watch me."
  END
191 Sebastian  END
192  shook   END
193 his  END
194  head in disbelief. "How am I going to tell the   END
195 king  END
196  about this?"   END
197 he  END
198  wondered.

Meanwhile,   END
199 Eric  END
200  had not forgotten about the mystery   END
201 girl  END
202  who had saved   END
203 his  END
204  life. Although   END
205 he  END
206  hadn't seen   END
207 her  END
208 ,   END
209 he  END
210  had fallen in love with   END
211 her  END
212  wonderful voice.   END
213 Eric  END
214  would have given   END
215 his  END
216  entire kingdom to find   END
217 her  END
218 ! Then, as   END
219 he  END
220  was walking with Max,   END
221 he  END
222  saw Ariel on the beach.
"Have we met before?"   END
223 Eric  END
224  asked,   END
225 his  END
226  heart skipping a beat. But   END
227 his  END
228  hopes were soon dashed when   END
229 he  END
230  found that Ariel could not speak.   END
231 She  END
232  can't be the one,   END
233 he  END
234  thought.

Still, the   END
235 prince  END
236  felt sorry for Ariel, so   END
237 he  END
238  brought   END
239 her  END
240  to   END
241 his  END
242  castle.   END
243 His  END
244  servants fed   END
245 her  END
246  and gave   END
247 her  END
248  nice clothes to wear.

The next day, the   END
249 prince  END
250  took Ariel for a coach ride through   END
251 his  END
252  kingdom. "  END
253 She  END
254 's so lovely,"   END
255 Eric  END
256  said to   END
257 himself  END
258 . "If only   END
259 she  END
260  were the   END
261 girl  END
262  I've been searching for!"

The next day, the   END
263 prince  END
264  took Ariel for a boat ride.
There isn't much time, thought Ariel. If   END
265 he  END
266  doesn't kiss me soon, I will become   END
267 Ursula  END
268 's slave.
Although Ariel didn't know it, the   END
269 prince  END
270  was falling in love and was just about to kiss   END
271 her  END
272 .

But Flotsam and Jetsam had been watching them. They tipped the boat over and sent the young couple tumbling into the water before Ariel could get   END
273 her  END
274  kiss!

  END
275 Ursula  END
276  had been watching the couple in   END
277 her  END
278  magic bubble.   END
279 She  END
280  decided to trick   END
281 Eric  END
282  so Ariel would never get   END
283 her  END
284  kiss. The   END
285 witch  END
286  transformed   END
287 herself  END
288  into a beautiful   END
289 girl  END
290 .
With Ariel's voice locked inside the seashell necklace,   END
291 Ursula  END
292  would sound just like   END
293 Eric  END
294 's true love!

The following day, as   END
295 Ursula  END
296  walked along the beach, the sound of Ariel's beautiful voice filled the air.   END
297 Eric  END
298  could hardly believe   END
299 his  END
300  ears! The   END
301 girl  END
302  who had saved   END
303 his  END
304  life had finally come back to   END
305 him  END
306 !
Quickly, the Sea   END
307 Witch  END
308  put a spell on   END
309 Eric  END
310 , and   END
311 he  END
312  decided to marry   END
313 her  END
314  right away.

  END
315 Ursula  END
316 's nasty trick had worked.   END
317 She  END
318  and   END
319 Eric  END
320  were to be married on   END
321 his  END
322  ship that very day!
In   END
323 her  END
324  cabin,   END
325 Ursula  END
326  laughed as   END
327 she  END
328  looked at   END
329 her  END
330  true reflection in the mirror. Luckily, Scuttle saw   END
331 Ursula  END
332 's real reflection, too.

Scuttle and Flounder rushed off to find Ariel and tell   END
333 her  END
334  all about the Sea   END
335 Witch  END
336 's latest trick.
"Don't worry, Ariel. We'll help you!" said Scuttle, as Flounder pulled   END
337 her  END
338  out to the ship. Then Scuttle flew to the ship.

With the help of sea lions, pelicans, and other birds, Scuttle stopped the wedding. As Ariel climbed over the railing, the birds tore at   END
339 Ursula  END
340 's clothing and pulled   END
341 her  END
342  hair. The seashell fell from   END
343 Ursula  END
344 's neck. When it broke, Ariel's voice returned to   END
345 her  END
346  instantly. Ariel called out to warn the   END
347 prince  END
348 .

Then   END
349 Eric  END
350  knew   END
351 he  END
352  had been tricked. But time had run out. The sun had started to set, and Ariel was already turning back into a   END
353 mermaid  END
354 .
"You belong to me now!" gloated   END
355 Ursula  END
356 , who had turned back into   END
357 her  END
358  mean, ugly self.   END
359 She  END
360  grabbed Ariel and slithered into the sea.

But   END
361 Eric  END
362  was not about to let Ariel slip away this time! Grabbing a harpoon,   END
363 he  END
364  dived into the sea and hurled it at the Sea   END
365 Witch  END
366 !

That made   END
367 Ursula  END
368  angrier than ever!   END
369 She  END
370  transformed   END
371 herself  END
372  into a huge monster and tried to crush poor Ariel and the   END
373 prince  END
374  with   END
375 her  END
376  black tentacles.
  END
377 Eric  END
378  clutched the Little   END
379 Mermaid  END
380  to   END
381 him  END
382 , trying to protect   END
383 her  END
384  from the   END
385 witch  END
386 's fury.

  END
387 Eric  END
388  knew   END
389 he  END
390  had to do something, and fast! Climbing aboard a ship that   END
391 Ursula  END
392 's angry thrashing had raised from the bottom of the sea,   END
393 he  END
394  grabbed the wheel.   END
395 He  END
396  aimed the ship's prow at   END
397 Ursula  END
398  and sailed full speed ahead! As the boat struck the   END
399 witch  END
400 ,   END
401 she  END
402  let out a terrible scream. Then   END
403 she  END
404  was gone.

Everyone was glad the Sea   END
405 Witch  END
406  was gone, but Ariel was still unhappy. Even Triton could see that   END
407 his  END
408    END
409 daughter  END
410  was truly in love. So, using   END
411 his  END
412  magic powers,   END
413 he  END
414  granted Ariel   END
415 her  END
416  dearest wish -   END
417 he  END
418  made   END
419 her  END
420  human again.

Triton watched as   END
421 Eric  END
422  and Ariel walked back to the castle.
"I'm going to miss   END
423 her  END
424 ,"   END
425 King  END
426  Triton said to   END
427 Sebastian  END
428 , "but I know they'll be happy."
Soon after that,   END
429 Eric  END
430  and Ariel were married in a splendid shipboard wedding with all the merpeople looking on. And just as   END
431 King  END
432  Triton had predicted, they lived happily ever after!
  END
